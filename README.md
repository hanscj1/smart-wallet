# YAKKL Smart Wallet

## Overview

YAKKL Smart Wallet is a multi-platform cryptocurrency wallet designed for seamless interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchains. It consists of two main components:
1. **Browser Extension Wallet**: A secure, user-friendly browser extension for managing digital assets.
2. **Solidity Smart Contracts**: A set of smart contracts built using Foundry to enable secure and efficient blockchain interactions.

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the YAKKL Smart Wallet, its purpose, and its importance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Highlight its multi-platform support and focus on security.

## Features

### Browser Extension Wallet
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Describe how the wallet supports multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Discuss the intuitive UI/UX designed for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Secure Key Management**: Explain how the wallet securely manages private keys and offers options like hardware wallet integration.
- **dApp Integration**: Mention the seamless integration with decentralized applications directly from the browser.

### Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Efficient Gas Usage**: Highlight optimizations made for minimizing gas costs in smart contract interactions.
- **Secure and Audited**: Describe the security measures taken, such as contract audits and formal verification.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Explain the modular architecture that allows easy extension and customization of the smart contracts.

## Architecture

### Browser Extension Wallet
- **Technology Stack**: List the key technologies used (e.g., TypeScript, Svelte, Web3.js).
- **Core Components**: Provide a high-level overview of the core components, such as the UI layer, wallet provider, transaction handler, and dApp connector.

### Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Contract Structure**: Explain the structure of the smart contracts, including main contracts, libraries, and utility contracts.
- **Foundry Integration**: Describe how Foundry is used for building, testing, and deploying the smart contracts.

## Installation

### Browser Extension Wallet Installation
- **Prerequisites**: List the prerequisites for installing the browser extension (e.g., supported browsers).
- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Build the extension using the provided scripts.
  3. Load the extension into the browser.
  4. Configuration steps (if any).

### Solidity Smart Contracts Installation
- **Prerequisites**: Mention the requirements for working with the smart contracts, such as Foundry, Node.js, etc.
- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies using Foundry's package manager.
  3. Compile the contracts.
  4. Deploy the contracts to a local or test network.

## Usage

### Getting Started with the Browser Extension
- **Creating a Wallet**: Guide users through creating a new wallet or importing an existing one.
- **Sending and Receiving Assets**: Provide instructions on how to send and receive cryptocurrency.
- **Connecting to dApps**: Explain how to connect the wallet to decentralized applications.

### Deploying and Interacting with Smart Contracts
- **Deploying Contracts**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying the smart contracts using Foundry.
- **Interacting with Contracts**: Examples of how to interact with the deployed contracts, including making transactions and reading data.

## Development

### Setting Up the Development Environment
- **Environment Setup**: Provide detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, including required tools and configurations.
- **Repository Structure**: Explain the structure of the repository and the purpose of each directory.

#### Initial github setup
#### Possible 402 Error
- git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400

This may be needed if you get a 402 error when pushing to github initially. The repo is large and the default buffer size may be too small. This would be a one time setup.

### Building and Testing
- **Building the Browser Extension**: Instructions for building the extension from source.
- **Testing the Smart Contracts**: Guide on running tests for the smart contracts using Foundry, including examples of test cases.

### Best Practices
- **Coding Standards**: Outline the coding standards followed in the project, such as code formatting, commenting, and documentation.
- **Security Practices**: List best practices for ensuring the security of both the browser extension and smart contracts.
